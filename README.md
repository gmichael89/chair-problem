# Chair Problem

My attempt at the below problem.

>Take a second to imagine that you are in a room with 100 chairs arranged in a circle. These chairs are numbered sequentially >from One to One Hundred. At some point in time, the person in chair #1 will be told to leave the room. The person in chair >#2 will be skipped, and the person in chair #3 will be told to leave. Next to go is person in chair #6. In other words, 1 >person will be skipped initially, and then 2, 3, 4.. and so on. This pattern of skipping will keep going around the circle >until there is only one person remaining- The survivor! Note that each chair is removed when the person leaves the room."
